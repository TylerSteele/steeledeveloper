Here's my _Fallout_ ðŸ’£ themed personal website! I decided to stick with pure HTML, JS, and CSS for this project. I don't think I'm doing anything here that requires more complex tech. 


Limiting myself did challenge me to go back to my roots and favor simpler design over flashy implementation. It was fun to get the gifs working on click of each 'dialog option'. I make sure the site is responsive and accessible (visually and for screen readers). I'm considering adding an option to disable animations, I went a little crazy with those.  

Also, I thought it would be funny if instead of the typical dark / light mode toggle, I allow toggling between _Fallout 3_ green and _Fallout: New Vegas_ amber. 

Using Vite and deploying with Vercel was laughably easy. We've come a long way!
