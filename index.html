        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, there! I'm Tyler Steele, a Software Engineer who’s passionate
          about human-centered design. I lead with compassion and empathy
          because software is built by people, for people. I’m driven to create
          technology that fosters a kinder, more connected world and I’m always
          eager to tackle new challenges to help make that vision a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created this portfolio to showcase my work and share a more personal
          side of myself. Its design pays homage to the
          <em class="colored-text">Fallout</em> ☢️ series (hopefully that's
          obvious!). Despite the wasteland setting, I'm inspired by the
          protagonists' ability to have a lasting, positive impact on the world
          around them. I hope to do the same in this one.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="software">
        <h2>My Work</h2>

        <p id="years-worked-text"></p>
        <p>
          In that time, I've contributed extensively to the following projects.
        </p>
        <h3>Metabolic Pathway Assessment Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
          I designed and built a serverless, scalable data pipeline capable of
          processing thousands of metabolic pathway assessments concurrently
          (<em>Python</em>, <em>Docker</em>, <em>Lambda</em>, <em>SQS</em>,
          <em>PostgreSQL</em>, and <em>RDS</em>). The results are viewable in a
          performant, responsive web app that strategically loads the data as
          needed (<em>TypeScript</em>, <em>NestJS</em>, <em>Vue</em>, and
          <em>EC2</em>).
        </p>
        <h3>Platform for Structuring Machine Learning Input Data</h3>
        <p>
          LanzaTech's machine learning team needed structured, labeled
          fermentation data in order to train predictive models. I was
          responsible for the application that allowed fermentation scientists
          to apply labels and metadata to runs (<em>Python</em>,
          <em>Django</em>, <em>TypeScript</em>, <em>ReactJS</em>). As the
          product owner, I led a months-long initiative to establish a new set
          of label definitions, facilitating complex discussions with over 10
          scientists.
        </p>
        <h3>National Insurer Quoting Experience</h3>
        <p>
          At Amica, I helped design and develop a beautiful, responsive
          <a href="https://www.amica.com/" target="_blank"
            >quoting experience</a
          >
          for millions of users (<em>TypeScript</em>, <em>ReactJS</em>, and
          <em>Redux</em>). This was a collaborative effort between developers,
          designers, and subject matter experts to meet user expectations,
          support multiple lines of business, and account for differing state
          laws.
        </p>
        <h3>Service Management Web App</h3>
        While at HomeX / Gem Plumbing and Heating, we were rolling out service
        plans for residential customers. The technicians needed a digital
        version of their paper sign-up form, so I worked with a tight-knit team
        to translate the paper form and complex plan structure to a web
        application interface (<em>JavaScript</em>, <em>NodeJS</em>,
        <em>Meteor</em>, and <em>ReactJS</em>).
        <h3>Poempath</h3>
        <p>
          Okay, this one isn't a professional example. But I thought it would be
          fun to share my
          <a href="https://github.com/TylerSteele/poempath" target="_blank"
            >poetry recommendation webapp</a
          >. It's like <em>Tinder</em> for poetry (swipe left and swipe right
          interactions) that uses a recommendation engine to suggest poems that
          people with similar tastes enjoy.
        </p>

      <section id="presentations">
        <h2>Presentations</h2>
        <p>
          No, I don't know much about wasteland survival. But I do know some
          things!
        </p>
        <p>I've presented on a variety of topics, including:</p>
        <h3>User Story Mapping</h3>
        <p>
          In this presentation, I summarized Jeff Patton's book
          <a
            href="https://jpattonassociates.com/jeff-pattons-book-released-user-story-mapping/"
            target="_blank"
            >User Story Mapping</a
          >
          and provided a detailed walkthrough of how to create a user story map.
          I was delighted to see many projects embrace the idea in the months
          following the presentation.
        </p>
        <h3>Isn't it Pythonic?</h3>
        <p>
          This Alanis Morissette-inspired presentation was a fun way to explore
          common Python pitfalls. In order to empower attendees to avoid them
          and write better Python code, I shared a detailed breakdown of how
          Python works 'under the hood'.
        </p>
        <h3>Terminal Coolness</h3>
        <p>
          It may seem trivial, but terminal customization can make development
          more joyful and streamline common workflows. This presentation
          scratches the surface of customization options and offers some
          sensible defaults.
        </p>
        <h3>Git Good</h3>
        <p>
          A recurring workshop of mine (I presented this at Amica and
          LanzaTech), this covers the basic git commands I've come to know and
          love: <em>status</em>,<em>add</em>, <em>commit</em>, <em>push</em>,
          and of course <em>rebase</em>. I also cover pull request review best
          practices and do my best to instill a love for clean commit history.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Flex and Grid Aren't so Spooky</h3>
        <p>
          In this
          <a
            href="https://github.com/TylerSteele/flex-and-grid-exercises"
            target="_blank"
            >halloween themed lesson</a
          >, I demystified CSS flex and grid in an attempt to encourage more use
          of it at Amica. I succeeded in my goal and we had fun stacking
          pumpkins along the way!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="fun">
        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>Thank you for your interest!</p>
        <p>Here's what makes me <em>me</em>.</p>
        <h3>Father of Two</h3>
        <p>
          It's cliché, but this is the most important part of my 'Personal'
          section. Most of my free time and decisions are dedicated to creating
          the best environment for my two sons. For now, this means a demanding
          schedule of playing pretend, and I welcome the challenge!
        </p>
        <h3>Dvorak Mechanical Keyboarder</h3>
        <p>
          A few years ago, I got into mechanical keyboards. In order to avoid
          falling down the rabbit hole, I set my sights on a singular vision and
          achieved it. I then promptly unsubscribed from all the keyboard
          subreddits and YouTube channels 😅 I also took the opportunity to
          relearn typing in Dvorak and break old habits. If you use a computer
          and someone left it in 'Dvorak' mode, that may have been me...
        </p>
        <h3>Recovering Gamer</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently on a gaming hiatus, trying to think more critically
          about how I'm spending my time (especially now that I'm a dad).
          However, I'll always have a deep love for interactive fiction and the
          power a virtual world can hold over you. Some of my favorite games are
          <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> (duh), <em>XCOM 2</em>,
          <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, <em>Into the Breach</em>,
          <em>The Beginner's Guide</em>, and <em>Inscryption</em>.
        </p>
        <h3>Theater Lover</h3>
        <p>
          If I could, I'd spend every night at the theater. There's something so
          magical about the dedication and craft that comes together on stage
          every night. Some of my favorite musicals are:
          <em>Into the Woods</em>, <em>Les Misérables</em>,
          <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, <em>Hadestown</em>,
          <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>, <em>Fun Home</em>,
          <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em> and
          <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>.
        </p>
        <h3>Vegan Teetotaler</h3>
        <p>
          I know, I know. I must be fun at parties 🎉 In all seriousness, core
          to my belief system is the notion that we must be accountable for our
          individual actions and live our values. Our society is well past the
          point of needing animal products, and drugs and alcohol ultimately can
          serve to disengage the masses from the greatest issues affecting
          humanity. If we focus more on the people and things that matter, we
          can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.
        </p>
        <h3>Devoted Podcaster</h3>
        <p>
          My best friend Brevin and I have co-hosted three successful (by our
          metrics 🙂) podcasts:
          <a href="https://computable.buzzsprout.com/" target="_blank"
            >Computable</a
          >,
          <a href="https://muchtodo.buzzsprout.com/" target="_blank"
            >Much To Do About Something</a
          >, and
          <a href="https://reddeadreflection.buzzsprout.com/" target="_blank"
            >Red Dead Reflection</a
          >. We'll be getting 'back in the saddle' whenever they decide to
          release Grand Theft Auto VI.
