        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, there! I'm Tyler Steele, a Software Engineer who’s passionate
          about human-centered design. I lead with compassion and empathy
          because software is not just a solution to complex problems, it’s a
          means to improve the lives of the people who use it. I’m driven to
          create technology that fosters a kinder, more connected world and I’m
          always eager to tackle new challenges to help make that vision a
          reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created this portfolio to showcase my work and share a more personal
          side of myself. Its design pays homage to the
          <em class="colored-text">Fallout</em> ☢️ series (hopefully that's
          obvious to fans!). Despite the wasteland setting, I'm inspired by the
          protagonists' ability to have a lasting, positive impact on the world
          around them. I hope to do the same in this one.
        </p>

        <h2>Software</h2>

        <p id="years-worked-text">
          I've been working as a software developer professionally for years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that time, I've contributed extensively to the following projects.
        </p>
        <h3>Platform for Structuring Machine Learning Input Data</h3>
        <p>
          LanzaTech's machine learning team needed structured, labeled
          fermentation data in order to train predictive models. I was
          responsible for the application that allowed fermentation scientists
          to apply labels and metadata to runs (<em>Python</em>,
          <em>Django</em>, <em>TypeScript</em>, <em>ReactJS</em>). As the
          product owner, I led a months-long initiative to establish a new set
          of label definitions, facilitating complex discussions with over 10
          scientists.
        </p>
        <h3>Metabolic Pathway Assessment Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
          At LanzaTech, we are interested in assessing bacteria's ability to
          produce various target products. This means performing various
          assessments of metabolic pathways (chains of reactions in the
          bacteria's metabolism). I designed and built a serverless, scalable
          data pipeline capable of processing thousands of metabolic pathway
          assessments concurrently (<em>Python</em>, <em>Docker</em>,
          <em>Lambda</em>, <em>SQS</em>, <em>PostgreSQL</em>, and <em>RDS</em>).
          The results are viewable in a performant, responsive web app that
          strategically loads the data as needed (<em>TypeScript</em>,
          <em>NestJS</em>, <em>Vue</em>, and <em>EC2</em>).
        </p>
        <h3>National Insurer Quoting Experience</h3>
        <p>
          At Amica, I helped design and develop a beautiful, responsive
          <a href="https://www.amica.com/" target="_blank"
            >quoting experience</a
          >
          for millions of users (<em>TypeScript</em>, <em>ReactJS</em>, and
          <em>Redux</em>). This was a collaborative effort between developers,
          designers, and subject matter experts to meet user expectations,
          support multiple lines of business, and account for differing state
          laws.
        </p>
        <h3>Technician Service Management Web App</h3>
        While at HomeX / Gem Plumbing and Heating, we were rolling out service
        plans for residential customers. The technicians needed a digital
        version of their paper sign-up form, so I worked with a tight-knit team
        to translate the paper form and complex plan structure to a web
        application interface (<em>JavaScript</em>, <em>NodeJS</em>,
        <em>Meteor</em>, and <em>ReactJS</em>). An important aspect of this was
        making the process appealing to low-tech users who enjoyed the paper
        process. This was the start of my interest in human-centered design.
        <h3>Poempath</h3>
        <p>
          Here's a personal project I enjoyed putting together!
          <a href="https://github.com/TylerSteele/poempath" target="_blank"
            >Poempath</a
          >
          is a poetry recommendation app. Like <em>Tinder</em> for poetry (swipe
          left and swipe right interactions), it uses a recommendation engine to
          suggest poems that people with similar tastes enjoy.
        </p>

      <section id="workshops">
        <h2>Workshops</h2>
        <p>
          No, I don't know much about wasteland survival. But I do know some
          things!
        </p>
        <p>I've led workshops on a variety of topics, including:</p>
        <h3>User Story Mapping</h3>
        <p>
          In this workshop, I summarized Jeff Patton's book
          <a
            href="https://jpattonassociates.com/jeff-pattons-book-released-user-story-mapping/"
            target="_blank"
            >User Story Mapping</a
          >
          and provided a detailed walkthrough of how to create a user story map.
          I was delighted to see many projects embrace the idea in the months
          following the workshop.
        </p>
        <h3>Docker: a Port in All Storms</h3>
        <p>
          When working on the Metabolic Pathway Assessment Pipeline, I spent a
          lot of time debugging failed docker builds. I realized there must be a
          better way, so I mastered the docker fundamentals and debugging. To
          solidify my understanding and distribute the knowledge, I decided to
          share my learnings with the team. This lesson covered the background
          (why Docker?), general overview (images, containers, volumes, etc.) as
          well as practical tips for digging into containers.
        </p>
        <h3>Isn't it Pythonic?</h3>
        <p>
          This Alanis Morissette-inspired workshop was a fun way to explore
          common Python pitfalls. In order to empower attendees to avoid them
          and write better Python code, I shared a detailed breakdown of how
          Python works 'under the hood'.
        </p>
        <h3>Terminal Coolness</h3>
        <p>
          It may seem trivial, but terminal customization can make development
          more joyful and streamline common workflows. This workshop scratches
          the surface of customization options and offers some sensible
          defaults.
        </p>
        <h3>Git Good</h3>
        <p>
          A recurring workshop of mine (I presented this at Amica and
          LanzaTech), this covers the basic git commands I've come to know and
          love: <em>status</em>, <em>add</em>, <em>commit</em>, <em>push</em>,
          and of course <em>rebase</em>. I also cover pull request review best
          practices and do my best to instill a love for clean commit history.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS Flex and Grid Aren't so Spooky</h3>
        <p>
          In this
          <a
            href="https://github.com/TylerSteele/flex-and-grid-exercises"
            target="_blank"
            >halloween themed lesson</a
          >, I demystified CSS flex and grid in an attempt to encourage more use
          of it at Amica. I succeeded in my goal and we had fun stacking
          pumpkins along the way!
        </p>

      <section id="fun">
        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>Thank you for your interest!</p>
        <p>Here's what makes me <em>me</em>.</p>
        <h3>Father of Two</h3>
        <p>
          It's cliché, but this is the most important part of my 'Personal'
          section. Most of my energy is are dedicated to creating the best
          environment for my two sons. For now, this means a demanding schedule
          of playing pretend, and I welcome the challenge!
        </p>
        <h3>Dvorak Mechanical Keyboarder</h3>
        <p>
          A few years ago, I got into mechanical keyboards. In order to avoid
          falling down the rabbit hole, I set my sights on a singular vision and
          achieved it. I then promptly unsubscribed from all the keyboard
          subreddits and YouTube channels 😅 I also took the opportunity to
          relearn typing in Dvorak and break old habits. If you use a computer
          and someone left it in 'Dvorak' mode, that may have been me...
        </p>
        <h3>Recovering Gamer</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently on a gaming hiatus, trying to think more critically
          about how I'm spending my time (especially now that I'm a dad).
          However, I'll always have a deep love for interactive fiction and the
          power a virtual world can hold over you. Some of my favorite games are
          <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> (duh), <em>XCOM 2</em>,
          <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, <em>Into the Breach</em>,
          <em>The Beginner's Guide</em>, and <em>Inscryption</em>.
        </p>
        <h3>Theater Lover</h3>
        <p>
          If I could, I'd spend every night at the theater. There's something so
          magical about the dedication and craft that comes together on stage
          each night. Some of my favorite musicals are:
          <em>Company</em>, <em>Into the Woods</em>, <em>Les Misérables</em>,
          <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, <em>Hadestown</em>,
          <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>, <em>Fun Home</em>,
          <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em> and
          <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>. Listen, Sondheim is the GOAT
          for a reason :)
        </p>
        <h3>Vegan Teetotaler</h3>
        <p>
          I know, I know. I must be fun at parties 🎉 In all seriousness, my
          belief system is founded on the notion that we must be accountable for
          our individual actions in order to live our values. Modern society is
          well past the point of needing animal products, and drugs and alcohol
          ultimately serve to disengage the masses from the greatest issues
          affecting humanity. If we focus more on the people and things (and
          animals...) that matter, we can create a better world for ourselves
          and future generations. Still, I'm a believer in progress over
          perfection, so I don't judge others for their choices. I just strive
          to do the best I can.
        </p>
        <h3>Devoted Podcaster</h3>
        <p>
          My best friend Brevin and I have co-hosted three successful (by our
          metrics 🙂) podcasts:
          <a href="https://computable.buzzsprout.com/" target="_blank"
            >Computable</a
          >,
          <a href="https://muchtodo.buzzsprout.com/" target="_blank"
            >Much To Do About Something</a
          >, and
          <a href="https://reddeadreflection.buzzsprout.com/" target="_blank"
            >Red Dead Reflection</a
          >. Actually, Red Dead Reflection has over 100k lifetime listens, which
          is sort of mind boggling. We'll be getting 'back in the saddle'
          whenever they decide to release <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>.
